# Low-Level-Designs

- Low-Level Design (LLD) stands at the core of software development.
- It provides a crucial bridge between a High-Level Solution and the practicality of its implementation. 
- This will assess your ability to create scalable, flexible, and maintainable software

## Fundamental Concepts


## Design Patterns

## UML

## How to approach Low-Level Design problems in Interviews
* Clarify and Gather Requirements:
    - Ask Relevant/Good Questions which help in understanding sytem features and behavior.
    - Ask What needs to be included in the current  system and future scope.
    - Don't assume anything and clarify with the interviewer.
    - Ask who is going to call the system.
    - 
* Visualize the system starting from outside to inside and identify Components, Objects, and behaviors:
    -  Nouns can be Entities
    -  verbs can be your behavior/functions
    -  
* Find the entities(classes) of the system and Identify the  relationship(Is a/Has a), and cardinality between them between different classes.
  
* Based on Entities and Relationships draw Schema Diagram(ER Diagram- optional)
    - Each class in the class diagram becomes a table in the Schema Diagram and the relationship between classes becomes the multiplicity between tables.
      
* Create Class Diagram(optional ask interviewer)  and Code against interfaces
  
* Keep in mind to follow the SOLID Principle, Design Pattern, and OOPS wherever possible

  Note: Some of them have hidden DSA Problem
